# 🏆 Leaderboard Project 🏆

[Click to check the leaderboard 🏆](https://avantikasingh2110-leaderboard.netlify.app/)

- A dynamic leaderboard application that allows users to add players, input their scores, and view the leaderboard in real-time. Players can be added with their first name, last name, country, and score. The leaderboard automatically updates, showing players sorted by score in descending order. Users can also increase or decrease player scores and remove players from the leaderboard.


## 📋 Features

- Add Players: Enter the first name, last name, country, and score to add a new player to the leaderboard.
- Sort by Score: The leaderboard automatically sorts players in descending order based on their score.
- Update Scores: Increase or decrease a player's score by 5 with the provided buttons.
- Remove Players: Easily remove a player from the leaderboard with a delete button.
- Responsive Design: The project is built with a responsive layout, ensuring it works on a variety of screen sizes.


## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the layout and form elements for player input and display.
- **CSS:** Styling the leaderboard UI with custom colors, fonts, and a clean, modern look.
- **JavaScript:** Handling the dynamic functionality of adding, updating, and sorting player data, as well as managing interactions like adding or removing scores.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Player Data:** The player information (name, country, and score) is stored in a JavaScript array.
- **Sorting:** The leaderboard is sorted based on the player’s score in descending order, ensuring the highest scores appear at the top.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Whenever a score is updated, the leaderboard re-renders, displaying the new sorted order.
- **Local Interactions:** Users can interact with the leaderboard by adding, updating, or deleting players without needing to refresh the page.


## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add user authentication (e.g., login/logout).
- Store player data in localStorage or a database to persist after page reload.
- Add sorting options (e.g., alphabetical sorting by name).
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels for better screen reader support.
